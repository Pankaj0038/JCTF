# Challenge Repo Guidelines Structure
1. Everyone is requested to push their challenge to a branch with their names instead of the main branch.
2. Make folders of individula categories with seperate folders for each challenge with their challenge name for example challenge named gpt-1 inside the pwn category will be inside the path pwn/gpt-1.
3. Every challenge must have three folders src, dist and solution and a README file containing the challenge name, description and dificulty.
4. Make sure to push the source code to the src path.
